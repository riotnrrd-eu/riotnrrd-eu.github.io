**Find The Thread** is the personal blog of Dominic Wellington. My usual bio reads something like "Speaker to Users | digital fl√¢neur | introvert but faking it", which gives you the general flavour: I'm in the business of explaining tech to non-technical people and vice versa, I do that by reading widely and distilling information across a wide variety of sources and topics, and while by nature I'm an introvert, I'm an ambivert by election, which means that I can be extroverted for a while but then I need to go and recharge on my own.

Topics on this blog are many and varied, hence the name. Some of the things I write about more frequently are [tech](https://findthethread.blog/categories/#tech), especially [enterprise IT](https://findthethread.blog/categories/#enterprise) and [Apple](https://findthethread.blog/categories/#Apple), but I also write about non-work things like [cars](https://findthethread.blog/categories/#cars), [cycling](https://findthethread.blog/categories/#cycling), and [books](https://findthethread.blog/categories/#books), and topics that span both [work](https://findthethread.blog/categories/#work) and play, like [travel](https://findthethread.blog/categories/#travel).
