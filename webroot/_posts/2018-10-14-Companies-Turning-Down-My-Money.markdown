# Companies Turning Down My Money


I’m [always]({% post_url 2014-01-29-Apparently,-borders-are-still-a-thing %}) [going on]({% post_url 2018-05-09-Apple-Abroad %}) about my troubles with the Italian iTunes Store, but I realise people might not know what that means in practice, so I wrote up a real-world scenario.

I wonder what movie we could watch on Sunday night – maybe that 1969 classic, *The Italian Job*?[^1]

First hurdle, finding the thing. Searching for "the italian job", as any reasonable (meaning "naive and inexperienced") person might, brings no results.

As this is not my first rodeo with the Italian iTunes Store, I fall back to searching for everything Michael Caine has been in – and sure enough, after the various *Batman* and *Kingsman* films, there is… *Un colpo all’italiana*. Sure, why not.

But once again, this is not my first rodeo – and therefore, instead of just hitting that "Buy" button, I know to scroll down and check one more thing:

Do you see it? 

Look under Language: there is only one entry, "Italian (Stereo)". No English audio. 

I refuse to pay ten Euros to hear Michael Caine dubbed into Italian, thank you very much. [If you won’t sell things to people, they won’t buy them]().

Guess we’re watching something else, kids.
