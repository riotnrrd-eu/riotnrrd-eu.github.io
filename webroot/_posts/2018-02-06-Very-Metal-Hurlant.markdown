Terminal 1, Paris Charles de Gaulle airport (CDG), looking like something drawn by Enki Bilal in the snow.

The interior of the terminal is also pretty cool. The whole building is a ring around an empty core, criss-crossed by transparent Habitrail-style walkways, complete with disconcertingly bouncy moving walkways.
