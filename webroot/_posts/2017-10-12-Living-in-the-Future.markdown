Oh, and I wrote and published this blog post on my phone.Â 

And I think I also made some phone calls, all while keeping on top of email, using social media, reading books and magazines, listening to music and podcasts, and finding my way around.Â

Twitter account exposes photos of debit and credit cards"Â ). No, it is very much not a good idea.
