# Here we go again


I read an article entitled [How Tinder co-founder Whitney Wolfe hacked Metcalfe’s Law](https://medium.com/message/how-tinder-co-founder-whitney-wolfe-hacked-metcalfes-law-f607dddbde66 "How Tinder co-founder Whitney Wolfe hacked Metcalfe’s Law - The Message - Medium" ), and thought: *Wouldn't it be nice if that were all there were to the story? "Genius co-founder drives her startup's app to success with ground-roots marketing campaign?"*

Instead of course it's yet another nasty story of tech-industry sexism, he-said/she-said and what looks like the nightmare scenario of a breakup with a co-worker gone about as bad as it could possibly go.  

We're better than this. Aren't we?
