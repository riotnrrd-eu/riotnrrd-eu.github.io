# Easiest blog platform ever


I was happy with Posterous until they got bought and shut down. I moved to Wordpress because they had a simple Posterous import tool, but I've been looking for an alternative to Wordpress since they annoyed me by not letting me edit raw HTML. Tumblr looked promising, but something put me off. 

Postach.io is looking like the best thing ever, tying in to Evernote which is already my go-to content tool. In fact if Jive, my work blogging platform, were to offer an Evernote plugin, I would pretty much never leave. 

Of course the proof of the pudding is in the eating. Let's see if I get back to blogging more frequently now!
