But there are also those moments when you walk into a room and you are greeted by an excitable small human who was unable to roll over an eyeblink ago, but now is gabbling on about the amazing castle they built with their wooden blocks, and who lives behind this door or in that tower, and what they will do next, and it all seems worth it.
