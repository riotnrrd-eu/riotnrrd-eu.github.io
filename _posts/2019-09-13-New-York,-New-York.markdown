This has been a great week in New York City. I was in town for New Hire Technical Training, or NHTT to its friends, which means pretty intense ten-hour days on top of the weeks of prerequisites to even get to this point – but it’s New York Freaking City, so I still took time to wander around. One day I got a step count in the 20ks!

Anyway, here are some shots from the week.
