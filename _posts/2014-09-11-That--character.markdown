# That  character


If you are wondering how to type the name of the Watch from your iOS device, wonder no longer.

It may seem odd, but that character is not part of the standard iOS keyboard - at least, not up to iOS 7. You can type it from a Mac (Shift-Option-8), but not from an iPhone or iPad.

Luckily, there is a fix.

From your iDevice, go to [mrgan.com/gb](http://mrgan.com/gb).

Voilà! Now you can copy the  character (or any other useful character) from Glyphboard into your review or tweet.

If this is a one-shot, you can use Glyphboard directly from Safari, but if you expect to be discussing the Watch regularly, you can save it to your home screen.

Hope this helps!
