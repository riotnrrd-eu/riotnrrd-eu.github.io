# Omnichannel


![](/images/image.88.png)

I had been thinking vaguely about starting a newsletter, but never actually got around to doing anything about it ‚Äî until [Twitter bought Revue](https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/twitter-acquires-revue/) and integrated it right into their product.

I wrote about *why* exactly I felt the need to add this new channel in [the first issue of the newsletter](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/dwellington/issues/find-the-thread-issue-1-363567) ‚Äî so why don't you head over there and [sign up](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/dwellington)?

And of course you should *also* sign up for [Roll for Enterprise](http://rollforenterprise.com), the weekly podcast about enterprise IT (and more or less adjacent topics) that I record with some co-conspirators.
