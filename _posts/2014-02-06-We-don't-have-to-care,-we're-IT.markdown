# We don't have to care, we're IT


Brian Katz comments with his usual incisiveness on Mobile Device Management (MDM) in "[IT is in the Experience Business](http://www.ascrewsloose.com/2014/02/06/it-is-in-the-experience-business/)”.

> MDM is dead and it’s been dead for a long time.

Oh thank $DEITY. As I have had occasion to [comment]({% post_url 2012-12-04-I-brought-my-device-for-me,-not-for-you! %}) myself, users don’t **want** their devices to be managed. They - or in fact *we*, since I’m a subject of MDM, not an admin - will tolerate a reasonable amount of inconvenience in the name of what we recognise as reasonable security requirements. What we **don’t** want is for our phones to end up like our Windows laptops, taking half an hour to boot and prone to all sorts of random malfunctions, slowdowns and incomprehensible roadblocks due to the number of “security” solutions they are larded down with.

This is exactly what is driving the enterprise adoption of Macs. Techies had been running Linux and maybe keeping the corporate Windows image around in a VM, but now civilians are moving to the Mac as fast as they can manage. Now we know the answer to the question “how bad do products have to be to drive even Muggles to change platform?”. 

> IT isn’t just in the solution business anymore. It can’t be reactive and spend months trying to build the perfect thing the business asked for but needed much sooner than IT could deliver. **IT is in the experience business.** Users need to have great interactions that lead to fantastic experiences that help them get stuff done and move the business towards its goal.

(Emphasis mine)

Exactly right. Enterprise IT apps are all overgrown with [feeping creatures]({% post_url 2014-01-21-Feeping-creatures %}), and users can’t get away from them fast enough. It doesn’t matter whether the apps are home-grown or COTS that has been customised, because the issue is not a technical problem but a *worldview* problem within IT.

Enterprise IT departments have always operated like [The Phone Company](http://snltranscripts.jt.org/76/76aphonecompany.phtml), but this is now a post-breakup world, and now IT *does* have to care. Users bring their own tools, their own devices, even their own *clouds*. Users help themselves and each other; anything to avoid dealing with the hell-desk.

But things don’t have to be this way. Brian concludes his post with this statement of the business of IT:

> We’re in the business of providing secure right time experiences that allow the user to (in the words of the army) be all they can be.

Now *that* is an IT vision that users might actually enjoy.
