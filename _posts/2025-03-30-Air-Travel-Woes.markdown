Check in with ITA[^1] be like: 

- Me: I would like to travel with this other passenger
- ITA app: lol that reservation does not exist
- Me: pretty sure it does
- My wife: I would like to travel with this other person (adds my reservation)
- ITA app: fu that reservation does not exist either haha
- ITA app: btw you are sitting at opposite ends of the plane now
- ITA app: \*crashes before I can save my boarding pass\*
- ITA check-in staff at LCY: if you want to sit together it will be ALL THE MONEY

Itâ€™s a real mystery why flag carriers are struggling when they provide the exact same service as low-cost airlines, just for more money.
