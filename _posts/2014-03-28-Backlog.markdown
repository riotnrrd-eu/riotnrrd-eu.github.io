# Backlog


From Alexis Madrigal’s excellent "5 Intriguing Things” newsletter (subscribe [here](http://d1ej5r2t2cu524.cloudfront.net/intriguingthings/5-intriguing-things-101/960729-tinyletter.com/intriguingthings?c=9c660312-bd46-4888-a423-8631a62a4498 "Subscribe to 5 Intriguing Things")):

Today's 1957 American English Usage Tip:

> backlog. orig. US (the large log placed in the hearth fire as a reserve), in its fig. use as reserve, support, is established in US commercial language, & is widely used elsewhere. Other est. Americanisms are backtrack, backwoods, &c.

Yes, the original backlog was a log.
