# Alternative Ties


I had kind of lost track of Duff McKagan after Guns ’n Roses imploded. Axl and Slash stayed more or less in the public eye, but Duff, Izzy and the others dropped off the radar. 

Now here he turns up doing Sweet Child of Mine, accompanied by Krist Novoselic of Nirvana - on the ***accordion***, of all things, and playing both the melody and the vocal part. [Check it out](https://youtu.be/QQ8Jz8Flw5Q)!

But what I really wanted to point out was that Duff is wearing a *tie*, of all the unexpected things for a member of Guns ’n Roses to wear. This just goes to prove my [ongoing]({% post_url 2014-11-18-Suits-You,-Sir %}) [contention]({% post_url 2013-11-25-Ties-that-bind %}) that a tie is the most alternative thing you can wear, now that showing up for business meetings in Chucks barely raises an eyebrow.
