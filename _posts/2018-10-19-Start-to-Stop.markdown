# Start to Stop


Today I had to join a call with Lync, or Skype for Business, or whatever it’s calling itself this week. As usual the process was unnecessarily painful. 

In particular, this screen always trips me up:

First of all, don’t ask me whether I joined successfully! *You* are supposed to tell *me* – or better yet, don’t *tell* me, just *do* it.

At this stage, this is the only Skype for Business window that I see, so no, I have not joined successfully – so “Skype for Business Web App” asks me whether instead I would like to join using “Skype for Business Web App”. You what?

Hitting that link opens up a separate Skype for Business Web App window, in which I can actually join the meeting, only lightly dazed by the force of the facepalming I endured on the way there.

This is some quality Microsoft UI, along the lines of their famous “to shut down, use the Start menu” flow.
