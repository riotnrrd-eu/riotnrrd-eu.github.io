# Advertise With The End In Mind


![](/images/unknown_filename.9.png)

Even though I no longer work directly in marketing, I‚Äôm still adjacent, and so I try to keep up to date with what is going on in the industry. One of the most common-sensical and readable voices is Bob Hoffman, perhaps better known as the Ad Contrarian. His latest post is entitled [The Simple-Minded Guide To Marketing Communication](http://adcontrarian.blogspot.com/2019/01/the-simple-minded-guide-to-marketing.html), and it helpfully dissects [the difference between brand advertising and direct-response advertising]({% post_url 2015-10-21-Enterprise-Brand-Advertising %}):

> \[‚Ä¶\] our industry's current obsession with precision targeted, one-to-one advertising is misguided. Precision targeting may be valuable for direct response. But history shows us that direct response strategies have a very low likelihood of producing major consumer facing brands. Building a big brand requires widespread attention. **Precision targeted, one-to-one communication has a low likelihood of delivering widespread attention**.

Now Bob is not just an armchair critic; he has quite the [*cursus honorum*](https://www.bobhoffmanswebsite.com) in the advertising industry, and so he speaks from experience.

In fact, events earlier this week bore out his central thesis. With the advent of GDPR, [many US-based websites opted to cut off EMEA readers rather than attempt to comply with the law]({% post_url 2018-06-24-Unintended-Consequences %}). This action helpfully made it clear who was doing shady things with their users‚Äô data, thereby providing a valuable service to US readers, while rarely inconveniencing European readers very much.

The *New York Times*, with its strong international readership, was not willing to cut off overseas ad revenue. Instead, they went down a different route (emphasis still mine):

> The publisher blocked all open-exchange ad buying on its European pages, followed swiftly by behavioral targeting. Instead, NYT International focused on contextual and geographical targeting for programmatic guaranteed and private marketplace deals and **has not seen ad revenues drop as a result**, according to Jean-Christophe Demarta, svp for global advertising at New York Times International.

Digiday has [more details](https://digiday.com/media/new-york-times-gdpr-cut-off-ad-exchanges-europe-ad-revenue/), but that quote has the salient facts: turning off invasive tracking ‚Äì and the targeted advertising which relies on it ‚Äì had no negative results whatsoever.

This is of course because knowing someone is reading the NYT, and perhaps which section, is quite enough information to know whether they are an attractive target for a brand to advertise to. Nobody has ever deliberately clicked from serious geopolitical analysis to online impulse shopping. However, the awareness of a brand and its association¬†with Serious Reporting will linger in readers‚Äô minds for a long time.

The NYT sells its own ads, which is not really scalable for most outlets, but I hope other people are paying attention. Maybe there is room in the market for an advertising offering that does not force users to deal with cookies and surveillance and interstitial screens and [page clutter]({% post_url 2019-01-08-The-User-Unfriendly-Web %}) and general creepiness and annoyance, while still delivering the goods for its clients?
