IT: "We won’t support you weirdos and your Macs."

Me: "Oh, so it’ll be like that time my Windows laptop lunched everything in the Registry to do with network interfaces, and your offered solution was for me to airmail you the hard disk drive for you to format it and reinstall the OS. Got it. Quaking in my boots, I am." *Proceeds to order MacBook*

*Time passes*

IT: “We will be upgrading the webmail servers \[which Mac Outlook relies on\] over the weekend.”

Me, on Monday morning: “How come I seem to have a 25% success rate in sending e-mails all of a sudden?”

*\*headdesk\**

I get that IT can’t support every crazy thing that users get up to. Really, I do. I used to be a sysadmin - ok, a PFY, but still.

But would it be too much to ask that at least things that *are* IT’s responsibility get done properly? Or is this going to be like the time I wrote in to point out an expired SSL cert, and was told that to make the error go away, I should stop using Firefox?
