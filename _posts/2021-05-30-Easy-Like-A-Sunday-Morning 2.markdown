# Easy Like A Sunday Morning


This Sunday morning was not a time for epic rides, not least because it's the day after a good friend's wedding… I took a 90-minute loop from my front door, up into the foothills and back down. This landscape has not changed much since Roman times, and probably before; people were tilling the land and making wine around here before the Romans showed up, at least [back into the Bronze Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terramare_culture).

This is the gate of [Rivalta](https://www.rivalta-trebbia.it/castle/), on the bank of the river Trebbia.

If the name of the river Trebbia is ringing a bell, you may be thinking of your classical history. This was the site of a [major battle of the Second Punic War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Trebia), in which Hannibal defeated the Romans. The battle is commemorated today by a statue of one of Hannibal's war elephants.

People never believe me when I tell them of the wildlife I encounter on my rides: rabbits, deer… elephants?
