# White Elephant


Latest pointless tech spotted in the wild: wireless charging points. Of course everybody is ignoring them in favour of good old sockets. 

It doesn't help that the wireless charging appears to require some sort of weird dongle that you have to go somewhere else to get, surrendering photo ID for the privilege. 

What, they couldn't use NFC? `/snark`
