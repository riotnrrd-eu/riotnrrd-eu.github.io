The last couple of weeks were pretty hectic, even by my standards. We went down to the Amalfi coast for a wedding, where people were swimming in the sea, it was shirtsleeves weather, and absolutely no stereotype was left unindulged.

It's amazing that this is just a handful of hours from my home by train, and you can watch the Italian countryside stream by at 300 km/h while you read your [book]({% post_url 2024-11-09-Seeing-Like-a-State %}) or get a bit of last-minute work done.

Then, after a little bit of this‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶we get straight to this:

Quite the contrast, and not just in temperature!

I was there for work, helping sixty-odd people get hands-on with all of this [GenAI](https://www.snaplogic.com/products/agent-creator) stuff as part of the agenda for SnapLogic Integreat, instead of just talking about it endlessly.

The lab went off pretty well, and I think it was also useful to help people contextualise what they saw later in the keynote presentations. It's not the best photo of me, but I was working, not posing!

After that it was time to relax in a completely different context:

This is the last photo of the night on my camera:

There was one final link between work and my personal life, as one of the closing speakers at Integreat was the CDO of the Lego Group; we even got custom minifigs!

Meanwhile at home, this weekend was [Piacenza Bricks](https://www.liberta.it/news/cronaca/2024/11/10/tutti-pazzi-per-i-mattoncini-novemila-visitatori-in-due-giorni-a-piacenza-expo/), showing off all sorts of Lego constructions, including a replica of local landmark, the [Gotico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palazzo_Comunale,_Piacenza):

And with that, I am **done** for a little while.
