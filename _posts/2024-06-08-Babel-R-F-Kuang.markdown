# Babel: Or the Necessity of Violence: An Arcane History of the Oxford Translators' Revolution, by Rebecca F. Kuang

The horrible suspicion that I might be Letty. That is what this book leaves me with, as a White child of Empire: I would not have been one of the Balliol boys, boozily judging all beneath them, but for all that I might be one kind of outsider, I am still in so many ways playing on easy mode. I feel Robin‚Äôs grief and horror, but it is not mine. 

But what a book. The meticulously researched details, cast into the background of one scene and never referred to again ‚Äî because what matters is the human stories playing out in the foreground.

This review was thumb-typed into Apple's Journal app. I started writing book reviews there, but found typing lengthy text on an iPhone keyboard to be more friction than I was willing to deal with. There is no sign of Apple bringing Journal to one of its platforms with proper keyboards, so at this point I have given up on the idea of keeping up these reviews.
