This notification was on my iPad:

A HUNDRED messages? Okay, maybe something blew up. I’ve not been looking at Facebook for a while, but I’ve been reluctant to delete my account entirely because it’s the only way I keep in touch with a whole bunch of people. Maybe something happened?

I open the app, and I’m greeted with this:

Yeah, no notifications whatsoever inside the app.

***Facebook is now actively lying to get its Daily Active Users count up.*** Keep this sort of thing in mind when they quote such-and-such a number of users.

To Facebook, user engagement stats are life itself. If they ever start to slide seriously, their business is toast. Remember in 2016, when [Facebook was sued over inflated video ad metrics](https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/288023/facebook-sued-over-inflated-video-ad-metrics.html)? Basically, if you scrolled past a video ad in your feed, that still counted as a “view”, resulting in viewer counts that were inflated by 80%.

Earlier this year, [Facebook had its first loss in daily active users in the US and Canada](https://www.recode.net/2018/1/31/16957122/facebook-daily-active-user-decline-us-canda-q4-earnings-2018). They are still growing elsewhere, but not without consequences, as the New York Times reports in a hard-hitting piece entitled [*Where Countries Are Tinderboxes and Facebook Is a Match*](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/21/world/asia/facebook-sri-lanka-riots.html).

At this point, I imagine anyone still working for Facebook is not nearly as forward with that fact at dinner parties or in bars, instead offering the sort of generic “yeah, I work in IT” non-answer that back-office staff at porn sites are used to giving.
