# Analogy


### Automation of single tasks with point solutions is equivalent to premature local optimisation of code.  

The worst part is, in both cases you may end up trapping yourself on a local optimum. It's hard to abandon these maxima and cross the valley to the higher peaks, no matter how attractive they look.  

It doesn't get easier over time, though. Start thinking holistically now. Talk to your peers in different teams. Better yet, talk to your users. They'll tell you what they need.
