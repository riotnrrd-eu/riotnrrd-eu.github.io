On Friday I had the chance to sit down with Alf, of *Alf’s Zoo*](https://plus.Google.com/+AlfAbuhajleh/posts "Alf Abuhajleh - Google+” )* fame. We had a great chat about automation, cloud and… cheese? You’ll just have to [watch the show](http://youtu.be/SXC8M-FNDfw)!

If you’re wondering about the art behind me, here are the two prints: [Ski Pluto](http://www.zazzle.com/ski_pluto_poster-228092648665992813 "Ski Pluto Poster from Zazzle.com") and [Visit Mars](http://www.zazzle.com/visit_mars_print-228123113602030172 "Visit Mars Print from Zazzle.com"). Both are by [Steve Thomas](http://www.stevethomasart.com "Steve Thomas Art & Illustration - Portfolio"). I had seen them linked ages ago and filed the bookmark, and when I was furnishing my home office in the new house I finally had somewhere to put them.

On a related note, every time I try to do something with Google Hangouts, I gain a better understanding of why WebEx has been so successful. Recording a ten-minute show took half an hour of futzing around. It’s one thing to do this if guest and host know each other already, but this would make a terrible first impression.
