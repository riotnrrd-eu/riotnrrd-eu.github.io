Here is how you become an adult. 

One day, you need to do a thing. 
First you panic. Then you learn how to do it. 
Then, you need to do the thing again. 
So you do it, and you do it like a boss, because now you know how to do it. 

That’s not how you become an adult. 
You become an adult when you teach other people to do the thing.

The same applies to becoming a good professional. It’s not about being the best at doing something. It’s about sharing that knowledge around. 

If you haven’t learned this yet, you’re not an adult – or a good professional.
