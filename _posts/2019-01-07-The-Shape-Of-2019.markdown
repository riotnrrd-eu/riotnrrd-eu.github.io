# The Shape Of 2019


> They said they need real-world examples, but I don’t want to be their real-world mistake

That quote comes from a [NYT story about people attacking self-driving vehicles](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/31/us/waymo-self-driving-cars-arizona-attacks.html). I wrote [about these sentiments before](), after the incident which spurred these attacks:

> It’s said that you shouldn’t buy any 1.0 product unless you are willing to tolerate significant imperfections. Would you ride in a car operated by software with significant imperfections?
> Would you cross the street in front of one?
> And shouldn’t you have the choice to make that call?

Cars are just the biggest manifestation of this experimentation that is visible in the real world. How often do we have to read about [Facebook manipulating the content of users’ feeds]({% post_url 2014-06-18-Privacy?-on-the-Internet? %}) – just to see what happens? 

And what about this horrific case?

Meanwhile, my details were included in last year’s big [Marriott hack](https://www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/marriott-hack-more-than-5-million-passports-exposed/), and now I find out that my passport details may have been included in the leaked information. Marriott’s helpful suggestion? A year’s free service – from Experian. Yes, [that Experian, the one you know from one of the biggest hacks ever](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/equifax-hack-hits-credit-histories-of-up-to-143-million-americans/2017/09/07/a4ae6f82-941a-11e7-b9bc-b2f7903bab0d_story.html). 

I don’t want to be any company’s real world mistake in 2019.
