# Know your audience


Is your core audience likely to react like [this](http://www.jwz.org/blog/2014/02/sxsw-has-fucked-everything-up-with-drm/)[^1] to whatever you’re planning?

If so, it’s probably a bad idea, and you shouldn’t do it.

My bill is in the mail.

[^1]: I’ve been there too. A few months ago I wrote a command that wrapped like twelve times in a standard Terminal window to unwrap some videos “protected” by Twistage. The only reason I didn’t share it here is that some particularly brain-dead paid video platforms also use the same mechanism, and I don’t want to help piracy.
