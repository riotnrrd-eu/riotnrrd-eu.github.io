So far this week my phone got me on a plane:

Around London by Tube and train:

Got me coffee, dinner and some light shopping:

Let me summon a car to my exact location, and pay for the trip:

Oh, and I wrote and published this blog post on my phone. 

And I think I also made some phone calls, all while keeping on top of email, using social media, reading books and magazines, listening to music and podcasts, and finding my way around.

Tell me again how phones are overpriced and boring? 🤔

You may have noticed that none of those images are of my actual phone, or of my own boarding passes and credit cards. That is because I am not a complete idiot. Yes, [people really do post pictures of those online](https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2012/07/03/need-a-debit-card-twitter-account-exposes-photos-of-debit-and-credit-cards/ "Need a debit card? Twitter account exposes photos of debit and credit cards"). No, it is very much not a good idea.
