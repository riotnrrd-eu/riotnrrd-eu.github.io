# Words to live by

> I grow little of the food I eat, and of the little I do grow I did not breed or perfect the seeds. 
> I do not make any of my own clothing.
> I speak a language I did not invent or refine. 
> I did not discover the mathematics I use.
> I am protected by freedoms and laws I did not conceive of or legislate, and do not enforce or adjudicate. 
> I am moved by music I did not create myself.
> When I needed medical attention, I was helpless to help myself survive.
> I did not invent the transistor, the microprocessor, object oriented programming, or most of the technology I work with. 
> I love and admire my species, living and dead, and am totally dependent on them for my life and well being.
> 
> Sent from my iPad
