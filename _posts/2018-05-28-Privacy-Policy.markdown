# Privacy Policy


Short version: I don’t have one.

Long version: I don’t gather any data, I even turned off Google Analytics (and not just because it was depressing me with its minuscule numbers!), and I don’t have access to the server logs even if I wanted to look at IP addresses or whatever. This blog’s host, Postach.io, have [their own privacy policy here](https://postach.io/site/privacy).

Regarding analytics specifically, I am somewhat curious about how many people read individual posts, but I’m not going to sell you out to Google so you can see adverts for whatever you read about here following you all over the internet for the next two weeks. Neither of us gets enough benefit for that to be worthwhile.
