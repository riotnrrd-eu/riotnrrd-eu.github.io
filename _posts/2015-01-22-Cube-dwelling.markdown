# Cube dwelling


I complain a lot on Twitter about open-plan offices, but they are not the worst working environment. Every time I spend any length of time in a US-style cube farm, I long for an open-plan office. Cubes are the worst of both worlds: enclosed enough that you feel hemmed in and cannot see daylight, but without any meaningful sound isolation.Â

Working from the living room table is good, but I really need to sort out the connectivity to my home office so that I can use it properly. A project for my copious free time!
