# Classification


I just found out about [Kurt Gebhard Adolf Philipp Freiherr von Hammerstein-Equord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_von_Hammerstein-Equord), and specifically this wonderful quote of his (emphasis mine):

>Â There are clever, hardworking, stupid, and lazy officers. Usually two characteristics are combined. Some are clever and hardworking; their place is the General Staff. The next ones are stupid and lazy; they make up 90 percent of every army and are suited to routine duties. Anyone who is both clever and lazy is qualified for the highest leadership duties, because he possesses the mental clarity and strength of nerve necessary for difficult decisions. **One must beware of anyone who is both stupid and hardworking; he must not be entrusted with any responsibility because he will always only cause damage**.

I do not generally like military metaphors, but this classification seems very applicable to the enterprise world. We can all think of that one person who would make an immeasurable contribution to the work by just stopping what they are doing.
