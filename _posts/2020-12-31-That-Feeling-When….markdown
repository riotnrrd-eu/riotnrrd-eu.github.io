# That Feeling When…


![](/images/72926CEB-1EF6-479E-B823-1EDC20FBB48E_1_201_a.jpeg)

You know that feeling when you realise you may be a *little* bit outside the design envelope for your gear? That.

I was on the Bianchi, my gravel bike, not my full-sus fat-tyre MTB, when I ran into a stretch of uncleared road. I thought it was just two corners' worth, but it turned out to be quite a bit more than that, and icy underneath the snow.

Not bad for the last ride of the year!
