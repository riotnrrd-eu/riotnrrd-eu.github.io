Something I wrote on Facebook which I thought was worthy of a wider outing: 

> Enormous amounts of hot air are produced over what people have in their pants and whose pants they themselves want to get into - a topic which is fascinating to the individuals concerned and should be of no interest to anyone else outside their immediate circle of friends & relations. 

The topic was a new iteration of [the endless argument over gender in language]({% post_url 2013-12-06-Minimum-Acceptable-Standard %}). I don’t think we solved it, but I am happy with my comment!
