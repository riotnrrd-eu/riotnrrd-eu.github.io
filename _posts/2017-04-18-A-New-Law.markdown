I was hanging out on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dwellington/ ), and I happened to notice a new pop-up, offering to help me boost my professional image with new photo filters.

My professional image may well need all sorts of help, but I do wonder whether this feature was the most productive use of LinkedInâ€™s R&D time.

Maybe this is the twenty-first century version of [Zawinski's Law](http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/Z/Zawinskis-Law.html ):

> Every social networking app attempts to expand until it has photo filters. Those apps which cannot so expand are replaced by ones which can.

(I did not use the filters.)
