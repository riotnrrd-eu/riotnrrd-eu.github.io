# Predictions


> The world of A.D. 2014 will have few routine jobs that cannot be done better by some machine than by any human being. [...] The lucky few who can be involved in creative work of any sort will be the true elite of mankind, for they alone will do more than serve a machine.

Isaac Asimov, "[Visit to the World's Fair of 2014](http://www.nytimes.com/books/97/03/23/lifetimes/asi-v-fair.html)", 1964
