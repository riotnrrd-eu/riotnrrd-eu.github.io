# Long Way Up, Short Way Down


Here are some more pictures from my adventures on the trails of Finale Ligure.

This is my faithful steed in the square of [Borgio Verezzi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borgio_Verezzi). Don't be fooled by the Wikipedia entry claiming elevation of only ten metres above sea level; that measurement must be from the railway station, down at the bottom of the hill. There is a lot more info on the [Italian-language wikipedia page](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borgio_Verezzi).

The actual town of Borgio is a medieval hilltop knot of houses, of a type that is popular all along this coast: far enough up to be out of easy reach for pirates or other attackers, with a confusing inside-outside architecture designed to disorient them if they did decide to invest their time in climbing all the way up here.

After a bit more climbing, we finally reach the church of San Martino, a full 271 metres from sea level, where I started pedalling. It's best to do this climb early in the day!

From here there are any number of trails across the top of the rocky spur known locally as the Caprazoppa ("the lame goat"). The most famous is the [Bondi](https://www.trailforks.com/trails/bondi/), named for a local hero who still operates a bike shop in the centre of Finalborgo. This, plus the more technical [X-Men](https://www.trailforks.com/trails/xmen-82618/) trail, make up the drop back down to sea level, just in time to hit the bakery for warm focaccia fresh from the oven.

The locals are sometimes bemused by MTB antics.
