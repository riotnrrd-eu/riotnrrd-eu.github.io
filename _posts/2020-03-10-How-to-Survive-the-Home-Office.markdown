## Some tips from someone who hasn‚Äôt worked in an office in fifteen years

In the twenty-first century, many of us work in offices. In the EU and the US, the service economy represents roughly 80% of GDP. This growth of service work is a relatively recent phenomenon, compared to the past when most employment was in agriculture.¬†

Office work comes with a number of perks over farming. For a start, it‚Äôs done indoors, generally in fairly comfortable surroundings. There may be perks like free refreshments, and if you are lucky you may even have fun colleagues that you like to hang out with during coffee breaks. You‚Äôre also fairly unlikely to be in any sort of physical danger, as long as you are careful with the stapler.

The problem is that the self-isolation protocols that governments and companies are putting into place require, among other things, that people work from home instead of going to the office. This is a new development for many employers and employees. In the spirit of helping out, I wanted to share some tips based on over a decade of working from home. I last had an office-based job in which I worked elbow-to-elbow with my team-mates in 2006. Since then, my situation has mostly involved team-mates and managers spread around the world, across many different time zones. Here is what I learned.

# Save your Space¬†

One of the good things about travelling to a physical location is that it enforces separation between work and not-work. If you‚Äôre in the office, you‚Äôre generally expected to be working ‚Äì and if you‚Äôre at home, generally speaking you‚Äôre not working, apart from perhaps checking email or whatever.¬†

When you work from home, you lose that separation. The risk then is that work and home life bleed into each other. On the one hand, you may find yourself working through meal times and into the evening, but on the other you might also get distracted by housework or errands.

If you can arrange it, physical separation is best. Don‚Äôt work from the couch; apart from anything else, that‚Äôs an ergonomic nightmare if you‚Äôre doing it all day, every day. Go somewhere to do work, and don‚Äôt go there when you‚Äôre not working. I‚Äôm lucky enough to have a home office that is physically separate from the family home, which is ideal, but not everyone will have that option, or be able to set it up at short notice.

At the very least, work from your laptop at the table, and close the laptop when you‚Äôre done. Even if you do dip into work after hours, do it from your phone, not from the laptop.

It might seem silly, but try to stick to office hours and dress: get out of bed and get dressed as if you were going to work. You have years of reflex telling you that when you shave or put on makeup (delete as appropriate to your own personal morning routine), you are going into ‚Äúwork mode‚Äù. Take advantage of those reflexes even if you aren‚Äôt leaving the home.

If you are able to do so safely, i.e. without close contact with others, you may also consider replacing your commute with a run or a bicycle ride, just to start your day off.

# Protect your Space

If you live with other people, you may need to negotiate this separation with them. If they see you in the house, they may ask you for your help, or to join in some activity, or just ask you questions. A physical indicator that you are working can be useful here. Again, if you have a specific location that you work from, that can be simplest: ‚Äúif I‚Äôm in the spare room with the door closed, please don‚Äôt bother me; if the door is open, I‚Äôm available for coffee or a quick chat‚Äù.

# Make your Routine

On top of physical routine, it‚Äôs good to break up your day into units of time, and dedicate each one to a specific task. The method I use is the [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique), which is simple and fun. Basically, get a kitchen timer, and use it to time your tasks and breaks.

# Over-Communicate

It can be very isolating to work at home on your own, if you are used to working cheek-by-jowl with your team. At least if everyone is self-isolating in their own homes, you don‚Äôt feel that you are being left out of impromptu conversations that happen in the office. There are ways of helping the team continue to feel and work like a team even when they are remote.¬†

The absolute bottom line is that you need a chat platform of some sort. [Slack](https://slack.com) is fast becoming the default, and has a free plan that is enough for most organisations at least to get started. Probably the biggest alternative is [Microsoft Teams](https://products.office.com/en-US/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software), but there are many other options.

Do not try to use WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, or similar mobile-only, single-threaded tools for anything beyond the smallest groups and simplest needs. Slack and similar tools allow you to create many channels, each dedicated to specific topics, and within a channel you can split a discussion off into a thread without cluttering up the main channel.¬†

Another benefit of dedicated work chat tools is to further that separation between work and personal time. Train yourself to stop looking at the work tool after hours. Managers, be sensitive and avoid abusing personal channels like SMS outside of actual emergencies.

# Catch my Video

Text chat is great for many things, but if you‚Äôre feeling lonely and isolated away from your team, turn on that webcam! We are social animals, and seeing people face to face really helps strengthen those team bonds. The coronavirus crisis is driving a huge uptake in video chat tools, especially [Zoom](https://zoom.us), which has a useful free tier.¬†

Another benefit of video meetings is that it reinforces your work routines, if only because you have to be presentable and ready to be seen on camera.¬†

# Track and Assess

Finally, it can be hard at the end of the day to work out whether you ‚Äúgot anything done‚Äù. There‚Äôs a simple fix for that too: track what you do during the day, and assess the results at the end of the day. You can do this as part of your Pomodoro Technique, jotting down a quick note about what you achieved during each Pomodoro interval. Depending on what type of work you are doing, this can also help you track your time, if that is a requirement. Even if you don‚Äôt have that kind of need, though, it can be good to close out the day by looking back on what you have achieved.

# Plan for the Long Term

The final reason to think about this topic now is that I suspect that many organisations that were only forced into supporting remote work by this crisis will find that it‚Äôs actually a great option, at least as a complement to their ordinary setup. Don‚Äôt fall into any bad habits because you think this setup will only last for a few days or weeks. Remote working is going to be much more prevalent in the future, so it‚Äôs worth getting it right straight away.

Do share any other tips that you personally know of or that work for you. I can usually be found on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dwellington).
