Let me share with you a short e-mail conversation I had earlier today, which perfectly illustrates why users will do anything rather than deal with their IT department, up to and including running their own servers.  

**Me**: Hey IT, what are the video conferencing standards we can support?

**IT**: Just use Lync - it's the standard!

**Me**: No, it's somebody else's meeting, and they asked what video conferencing standards we can support.

**IT**: I don't know anything about this meeting, and anyway it's up to them to send you an invitation you can accept.

**Me**: Agreed, and they are asking what I can accept, hence my question about which video conferencing standards we can support.

**IT**:  \* silence \*


As usual, Dilbert is spot-on: I am obviously dealing with [Mordac, the Preventer of Information Services](http://search.dilbert.com/comic/Mordac%20The%20Preventer "Mordac The Preventer on Dilbert.com").
