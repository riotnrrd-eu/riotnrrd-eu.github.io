# I'm published!


A piece I wrote on Heartbleed was published in [Cloud Computing Intelligence](http://cloudcomputingintelligence.com) magazine: [Once you’ve dealt with Heartbleed, how do you prevent it recurring?](http://cloudcomputingintelligence.com/features/item/1160-once-you-ve-dealt-with-heartbleed-how-do-you-prevent-it-recurring).

Summary and lead-in:  

> You've got rid of Heartbleed, and you're relaxing with a soothing cup of something strong, but how do you know that it's gone for good? Dominic Wellington looks at creating a containment policy for Heartbleed and for any subsequent nasty bug that will stop them from coming back to plague you again.

Feedback welcome!
