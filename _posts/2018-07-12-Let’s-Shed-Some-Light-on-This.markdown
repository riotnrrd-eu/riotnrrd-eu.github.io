# Let’s Shed Some Light on This


Do you know what would be really great, when I fly in from a time zone quite a few hours misaligned with the local one? It would be fantastic if you all did not *immediately lock me in a room without any windows for several hours*. I mean, that’s bad enough for people who have to work there all the time, but it’s murder for those of us whose home timezone is many hours adrift from local time.

Meeting rooms with *actual daylight* would be a great help to the much-abused circadian rhythms of overseas visitors. That way we can avoid coming down with a bad case of [SAD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasonal_affective_disorder).

Meanwhile, I will continue to self-medicate with my own cocktail of melatonin and gin&tonic. Cheers!
