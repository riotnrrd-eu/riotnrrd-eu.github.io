# Spring is a time for new beginnings


(╯°□°)╯︵ ┻━┻

After 7 years, it's time to move on. Today is my last day at BMC, then I get a whole *one day off* - and even that only because it's a public holiday - before I start my next gig. 

Today I hand in my badge and gun - er, I mean, MacBook - and on Monday morning, bright and early, I will be in San Francisco to start my new job at [Moogsoft](http://www.moogsoft.com). *I could not be more excited!* 

It's definitely a wrench to leave after so many years, and so many different roles. In particular, I have to admit that I will miss the view from BMC's Milan offices, with the Alps in the background:

Onwards to new adventures!
