# One more thing


![|858x846](/images/123104.jpg)

Looks like the [Apple event](http://www.theverge.com/2013/10/18/4852280/apple-ipad-5-event-what-to-expect) on the 22nd is effectively the "one more thing" of the iPhone event, not just the Mavericks launch. 

Also MG Siegler is [pouring some cold water](http://parislemon.com/post/64487290048) on the rumours of a radically new Apple TV unit. I'm looking to buy a second Apple TV in mid-November, so a spec bump would be enough for me as a reassurance that I will be compatible with the New Hotness when it comes out. The current device will be relegated to AirPlay and occasional YouTube duty.

Of course this would be the week I'm without broadband due to moving house, which is why I'm blogging and having lunch at the pub; strictly for the free wifi, of course. The pint of microbrew bitter? Oh, that's just to pay for the wifi… Ahem.
